# Plus 12

A split keyboard with a bunch of different options.
There are 2 basic main matrix options, either 5 or 6 columns.
There are 3 main thumb configurations:
a full circuluar curve, adjustable down to 3 keys,
a circular curve into a straight row at key four, adjustable down to 5 keys (4 and fewer is the same as the full circle),
a straight row of keys, adjustable down to 3 keys.
There is potential for a 4x2 grid (like a Mitosis board) in the works as well.

Right now, the option exists to use little cutouts on the boards to help break the boards apart,
and trim the remaining bits with pliers.
The other option is to use a PCB shear, which would make the PCBs easier to manufactor 
(no internal cutouts), but would make it harder to do at home.
For production, I have access to a PCB shear, so it will probably just be a silkscreened line.

TODO: swap out straight interconnects for 4x2s, add pictures
