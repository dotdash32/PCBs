A split keyboard with a bunch of different options.
There are 2 basic main matrix options, either 5 or 6 columns.
There are 3 main thumb configurations:
a full circuluar curve, adjustable down to 3 keys,
a circular curve into a straight row at key four, adjustable down to 5 keys (4 and fewer is the same as the full circle),
a straight row of keys, adjustable down to 3 keys.
There is potential for a 4x2 grid (like a Mitosis board) in the works as well.
